# File Descriptions

## CharCounter.java
Java file using HashMaps for counting the characters in a string, and reporting the most common character. HashMaps use a 
"key/value" pairing to save and sort information.
This file can easily be modified to display the number of times that each character is encountered as it is a Map.
